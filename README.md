# Scrape-favorites-list-on-Craigslist

‘One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.’  

I had a difficult time while comparing specs of used cars I marked on Craigslist to make decision. There are many Craigslist scraping script available on the Internet to scrape listings under certain categories. However,  I didn't find a simple script to get items on my fav list. So I made my own. 


To use it, simply copy your favorites url and paste it to fav_url = ''
